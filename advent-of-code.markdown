# Motivation

Learning to program by working through programming puzzles that slowly escalate in difficulty level.

# Source Material

The source for our programming puzzles will be [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about){:target="_blank"} (henceforth referred to as AoC).

We're going to work through the puzzles for each day starting at the very beginning of AoC in 2015.

Each post will contain text and videos demonstrating and explaining one or more approaches to solving the puzzles presented.

# Prerequisites

These posts will be of interest for beginner to intermediate programmers. 
You should need almost no experience programming to follow along and learn from them, but I am going to assume that you have a basic
familiarity with the [Ruby Programming Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"}

If you have some experience with another language, Ruby should be relatively easy to pick up. 
Checkout [Learn X in Y Minutes, Where X=Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"} for a quick introduction.

If you have no experience whatsoever here are some resources that you should take a look at first.
You don't need to look at all of them, pick the one that you like best.

+ [Try Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/){:target="_blank"}
+ [Ruby in 20 Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/){:target="_blank"}
+ [_why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/){:target="_blank"}
+ [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby){:target="_blank"}
+ [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/){:target="_blank"}
+ [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/){:target="_blank"}

# Tools

In order to keep things as simple as possible and focus on one thing at a time, all of these posts and videos will be 
using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/){:target="_blank"} so that you can do all of this work in the browser without worrying about:

+ installing Ruby
+ using a Terminal
+ selecting a text editor

# What to Expect

In the videos, I am going to move fast and I will not be pausing too often or explaining things in great depth.
It is unlikely that you will be able to keep up with them at first and that is ok. 
Pause them often, follow along writing the code in your own browser, and write down questions you have as you go. 

The posts that go along with the videos will cover things in a lot more detail and include links to other resources where you can learn more.

The goal here is for you to get a window into what it looks like when I write code and gain some insight into how I think about using code
to solve problems. The onus is on you to use the various resources provided to research answers to different questions you have
and to clarify areas that you are unclear about.
